<h3>Implementation</h3>
   
     
<hr>
<h3>Application</h3>
<ul>
<li>Goods carrying and management: The bot can be upgraded to track and follow staff in industries that help and carry much heavier loads and dynamically follow any path followed by a staff which results in efficiency and effectiveness and is economical to the industries.</li>
<li>Research: Ball following bots can be used in research settings to study various aspects of robotics and machine learning, such as object detection, tracking, and control.</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h3>Future plans</h3>
<ul>
<li>Machine learning models can be implemented to make the bot work in complex dynamic environments.</li>
<li>Image analysis part can be used for home automated security systems, automated CCTVâ€™s which can track intruders and click pictures and send them over wireless systems.</li>
<li>The bot can be upgraded by replacing raspberry Pi with jetson nano to provide GPU power for object detection and model training dynamically and to help in building real-time applications.</li>
<li>Currently working on integrating neural networks and the bot to build bots like a person following an object following bot which helps in carrying and deploying heavy objects at the desired destination without human intervention.</li>
